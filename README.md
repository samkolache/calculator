The final project for the Odin Project Foundation project. Before starting the Odin project, I thought building a calculator would be simple. I challenged myself by only using what I learned and not to use any obvious google searches, example "how to chain functions in javascript". I can most definitely make the code in the JS simpler, but that is for another day. I wanted to create this project to demonstrate my improved knowledge in HTML/CSS and Javascript. I sharpned my DOM, and overall logic skills in Javascript. The functions of the calculator are below

1. Each number clicked shows on the display, clicking an additional number creates a larger number.
2. Add, Subtract, Multiplication, and Division buttons do, well, there respected functions.
    a. You are able to chain functions, 5 + 3 - 2 will result to 6. 
    b. If you chain functions, hit the equal button, and continue to chain, the result will be correct. (BIG PROBLEM I HAD)
3. A clear button, that resets all values and resets the display to 0
4. An equal button, that stores the values made before and calculates the overall value

This was a very rewarding project to polish my HTML/CSS skills, especially flexbox. I will know start the second phase of the Odin project and learn how to make my code simpler.
