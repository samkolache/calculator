# Calculator

## A Calculator created with HTML/CSS and JavaScript

I built a calculator as part of my Front End development studies through the Odin Project. This project proved to be the most challenging for me as the logic wasn't making sense at first. But I was able to refine my DOM skills and enhance my problem-solving abilities. The biggest challenge I faced was combining multiple operations (e.g. 8 + 4 * 3 - 4). Overall, this project helped me to improve the following skills.

**CSS**

* Flexbox to create the layout of the calculator

**JavaScript**
* Functions to perform all operations
* DOM manipulation to change the number on the screen
* DOM methods and events to calculate answers when user clicks buttons
* Logic to string multiple operands

### User Instructions
    1. User loads onto the page and can start their calculation
    2. User can continue operations until a final result is achieved
    3. A clear button can be pressed to start the operations over again

#### Disclaimer
The "Positive or Negative" and "Back" buttons do not work on the calculator. I plan on adding this function soon.
